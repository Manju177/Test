Create a simple multi-step form with two steps. Each step should have a different set of input fields (the first step should have one or two input fields and the same for the second one), and users should be able to move between steps using the next and previous buttons.
2. Implement input field validation for each step of the form. Show appropriate error messages if required, fields are empty or if the data entered does not meet specific criteria (e.g., valid email address, minimum password length).
3. Ensure that the form data is retained between steps so that users can freely move back and forth without losing their entered data.
4. Implement form submission functionality that logs all the entered data to the console when the user completes the final step and submits the form.
5. Allow the form to be easily extensible to accommodate a variable number of steps, each with its unique input fields and validations. Use appropriate data flow patterns to handle the form data across different components.
6. Enhance the form validation to include client-side validation for all steps. Disable the form submission button until all steps have valid and complete data.
7. Add a final step in the form that displays a preview of all the entered data. Users should be able to review their input and make any necessary changes before submitting the form.
